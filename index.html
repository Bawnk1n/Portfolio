            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class = "about-me">Greetings, and welcome to my portfolio webpage! My name is Garyk Simpson, a Canadian national and a dedicated web development student. Currently, I am on a fascinating journey, travelling through Latin America while simultaneously learning coding skills.</p>
            <p class = "about-me">Currently, I am in the early stages of the Full Stack Engineer career path program at Codecademy. While I have completed the first third of the program, I am continuously learning and enhancing my skills every day. I have a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am eager to explore other programming languages and technologies as I progress through the course. My goal is to become a proficient web developer and contribute to the development of innovative and engaging web applications.</p>
            <p class = "about-me">Apart from my interest in coding, I enjoy a variety of hobbies that include mountain biking, hiking, travelling, skiing, and video games. These hobbies have taught me to be persistent, curious, and to value teamwork, qualities that I believe are essential in any profession.</p>
            <p class = "about-me">My approach to web development is to keep learning and growing. My travel experiences have taught me the importance of being adaptable and resilient, traits that I hope to apply to my work as a web developer.</p>
            <p class = "about-me">I am thrilled to be on this journey of discovery and to have the opportunity to collaborate with other professionals in the field. Thank you for visiting my portfolio webpage, and I look forward to exploring new opportunities with you.</p>
